# Casadei Landings
A Next.js + Tailwind + Netlify project to create beautiful landing pages without code required.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
